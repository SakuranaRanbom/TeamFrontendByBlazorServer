## What is Blazor

Blazor is a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/tour):

- Create rich interactive UIs using [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) instead of [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).
- Share server-side and client-side app logic written in .NET.
- Render the UI as HTML and CSS for wide browser support, including mobile browsers.
- Integrate with modern hosting platforms, such as [Docker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/microservices-architecture/container-docker-introduction/index).

Using .NET for client-side web development offers the following advantages:

- Write code in C# instead of JavaScript.
- Leverage the existing .NET ecosystem of [.NET libraries](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/class-libraries).
- Share app logic across server and client.
- Benefit from .NET's performance, reliability, and security.
- Stay productive with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Build on a common set of languages, frameworks, and tools that are stable, feature-rich, and easy to use.
